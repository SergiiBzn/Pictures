# Pictures App

The **Pictures App** is a web application designed for browsing and managing a collection of images. Built using **Gulp**, **MAMP**, and **json-server**, the app demonstrates how to integrate front-end technologies with a mock API for managing and displaying pictures.

## Features:
- **Image Gallery**: Display a collection of images fetched from a simulated backend.
- **Dynamic Content**: Fetch and display data using **json-server** to simulate real-time updates.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure the app is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Gulp for Task Automation**: Use Gulp to automate tasks like compiling Less into CSS, optimizing images, and more.

## Technologies Used:
- **HTML5**: For creating the structure of the app.
- **CSS & Less**: For styling the app and making it visually appealing.
- **JavaScript**: To implement dynamic functionality and interactions.
- **Gulp**: For task automation and optimization of development workflow.
- **MAMP**: For local server setup during development.
- **json-server**: Simulates a RESTful backend API to manage image data.

## Setup:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run `gulp` to start the development process and serve the app locally.
